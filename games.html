                        This game resulted in a huge win for the knicks during their campaing to end up in second place in the eastern conference
                        during the 2012 season. The Bulls were another strong competitor in the east and these teams have been building a rivalry during
                        the Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose eras. The game ended with Carmelo Anthony hitting the game tying shot in regulation and then hitting the 
                        game winning shot in the final seconds of overtime at Madison Square Garden.

                        This was game 6 of the eastern conference finals last season with the Islanders trailing 3-2 in the best of 7 series. If they lost
                        this would be the last game ever at the Islanders much loved stadium, Nassau Coliseum. All of the fans were as loud as ever. The Islanders came back from
                        a 2-0 deficit in the second period to force overtime where Anthony Beauvillier scored the game winner in just over 1 minute of play.

                        Entering this game the Patriots were 13 point favorites against the Giants. The Patriots were undefeated and trying to become the first team
                        to ever go undefeated and win the superbowl. With 1 minute left the Giants were down 14-10 and desperately needed a 1st down to keep their drive alive.
                        Eli manning escaped pressure and threw a ridiculous pass to tight end David Tyree who made an impossible catch to extend their drive which ended up resulting in a game winning touchdown just seconds later.
