                            In the last 20 or so years the Knicks have been a major dissappointment with the exception of one season in 2012-2013. 
                            This all changed last year with the Knicks first playoff berth in 7 years. The emergence of their young
                            core including RJ Barret, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson Obi Toppin along with the resurgence of vet's 
                            like Julius Randle and Derrick Rose helped give the franchise new life. Randle, Rose and Barrett
                            were the most crucial contributers to the team and helped catapult them into the 4th seed in the east, 
                            however they could not get past they Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After bringing in free agents
                            Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker this off season to significantly Improve their backcourt, the knicks are looking 
                            to build on their recent success and win their first playoff series in almost a decade.

                            The Giants have had the worst record in thet NFL out of any team through the last
                            5 seasons. They have been absolutely awful shwoing no signs of hope for any success.
                            Dave Gettlemen, the Giants general mananger, has deservedly gotten a lot of criticism for the teams recent struggles.
                            He failed to deliver on his promise of building a good offensive line miserably and has made controversial trades and draft selections during his 4 year tenure.
                            In one of Gettlemen's best decisions, he reached to draft Daniel Jones, the Giants quarter back in 2019, who has proved that he is good enough to be a starter
                            in the NFL. Despite this there has been horrible coaches and players put around him consistenly, leading to failure. With that being said, in year 4 of the Gettlemen 
                            era and no signs of improvement, if the Giants don't play significantly better this year the whole team could be rebuilt by next season.

                            The past few seasons have been the best hockey that the New York Islanders have played in 30 years. In the past three seasons
                            They made it to the second round of the playoffs and the eastern conference finals twice. Both trips to the eastern conference finals were
                            against the Tampa Bay lightning, who won the Stanley Cup the past two years. Last season, they lost in game 7 in a 1-0 game. This team is and will 
                            continue to be carried by its strong defensive play and elite goaltending tandem. Adam Pelech and Ryan Pulock have both been signed to long term extensions this
                            off season and will continue to provide elite minutes as the isles top defensive pairing. The teams forward core of Josh Bailey, Brock Nelson, Anders Lee 
                            J.G. Pageau is starting to age along with defensemen Zdeno Chara and Andy Greene. This team has to be in full win now mode or else their core will start to decline to heavily to compete.
                            This team was one win away from the stanley cup last year, and should hope that Oliver Whalstrom, Noah Dobson, Anthony Beauvillier and Matt Barzal continue to improve which would help them
                            immensely in their quest for the Cup.
