                    <p>
                        Metlife Stadium is part of the meadowlands sports complex in East Rutherford New Jersey. When the building was completed 
                        it was the most expensive stadium in America. The buildings design was inspired by the look that the skyscrapers in NYC have, 
                        although the stadium isn't really physically appealing at all. Metlife stadium also hosts the New York Jets and is one of three stadiums 
                        in America that houses two teams from the same professional sports league. 
                        It is the third most expensive stadium in the NFL and can seat the 8th most amount of people. Both the Giants and Jets have been bad for the last decade
                        leading to bad times for most of the hometown fans that want to watch their team.

                    For their whole history the Islanders have played at Nassau Coliseum. Despite an attempt to renovate their old arena the Islanders were
                    still pressured to move out of it because it was simply just too old and not up to par with other modern arenas in the US. Nassau Coliseum 
                    hosted the Islanders when they one four straight Stanley Cups between 1980-1983 and the stadium has a lot of sentimental value to the fanbase. Because of this 
                    the interior of UBS Arena has been modeled to capture the same atmosphere as Nassau Coliseum. It will be built with a low cieling to emulate the extremely loud atmosphere created
                    by the low cieling at Nassua Coliseum.
